# DISCLAIMER
This is a minified version of the google-api-python-client.
I created this version to delete unused code (discovery cache & docs) for all google services except Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Slides and Youtube to make the dependency slim.
This code refers to the version 2.111.0 (2023-12-12)
For the docs, go to the official repo:
